# CloudQA Developer Internship - Automation Task

## Overview
This project contains an automated test script written in **JavaScript** using **Selenium WebDriver** to test three fields on the [CloudQA Automation Practice Form](https://app.cloudqa.io/home/AutomationPracticeForm).

The main goal is to create a robust script that can reliably interact with the form fields even if their position or certain HTML properties change.

## Features
- Automates filling and validating three different fields on the form.
- Uses stable selectors (like element IDs, names, or other attributes) to ensure the test remains stable.
- Written in JavaScript with Selenium WebDriver for cross-browser compatibility.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Selenium WebDriver
